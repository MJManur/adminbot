    <h2><strong>What is Admin BOT?</strong></h2>
    <p>Admin BOT is a highly versatile support bot for Discord which started development in 2023.</p>
    <p>It allows private support channels, which we call tickets, between your staff team and individuals who look for help.</p>
    <p>Itâ€™s highly customizable, giving you the freedom for it to be the perfect fit for your server.</p>
    <p>There is no need for complex setup or multiple commands to perform simple actions. You can easily interact with the bot using both the Dashboard and Discord chat commands.</p>
